Cradle Song
William Blake

SLEEP sleep beauty bright  
Dreaming in the joys of night; 
Sleep sleep; in thy sleep 
Little sorrows sit and weep.
 

Sweet babe in thy face 5 
Soft desires I can trace  
Secret joys and secret smiles  
Little pretty infant wiles.
 

As thy softest limbs I feel 
Smiles as of the morning steal 10 
O'er thy cheek and o'er thy breast 
Where thy little heart doth rest.
 

O the cunning wiles that creep 
In thy little heart asleep! 
When thy little heart doth wake 15 
Then the dreadful night shall break.
