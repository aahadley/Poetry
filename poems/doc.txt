Doc Hill
Edgar Lee Masters

I went up and down the streets
Here and there by day and night,
Through all hours of the night caring for the poor who were sick.

Do you know why?
My wife hated me, my son went to the dogs.

And I turned to the people and poured out my love to them.

Sweet it was to see the crowds about the lawns on the day of my funeral,
And hear them murmur their love and sorrow.

But oh, dear God, my soul trembled, scarcely able
To hold to the railing of the new life
When I saw Em Stanton behind the oak tree
At the grave,
Hiding herself, and her grief!
