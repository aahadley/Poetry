When We Two Parted
George Byron

When we two parted
  In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
  To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
  Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
  Sorrow to this.


The dew of the morning
  Sunk chill on my brow—
It felt like the warning
  Of what I feel now.

Thy vows are all broken,
  And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
  And share in its shame.


They name thee before me,
  A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—
  Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
  Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,
  To deeply to tell.


In secret we met—
  In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
  Thy spirit deceive.

If I should meet thee
  After long years,
How should I greet thee?—
  With silence and tears.
